<TITLE>Job Keywords Application Overview</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
    The Job-Keywords application searches Indeed.com and passes the detailed job descriptions through a term extractor
    that counts the most frequent terms that appear.
    <p />
    The application integrates two RESTful APIs and stores the results in an in-memory repository. For now, previous
    search results will be lost after the server is restarted.
    <p />
    This application is built with Java 8, Spring 4.1.6 and spring-boot. One goal was to demonstrate the simplicity of
    buildling an application with spring-boot. A web application can be built with about 10 lines of code - a single
    java source file and a single HTML file.
    <p />
    The spring-boot framework automatically configures a bunch of stuff that used to be cumbersome when building Java
    apps. While automatic configuration has many benefits, it can be tedious to figure out why manual configuration can
    sometimes break the auto-config thus breaking the app. For example, it's difficult to manually configure Jackson's
    JSON and XML converters and it's difficult to override the automatic configuration for View Resolvers such as
    Thymeleaf, JSP and JSON.
