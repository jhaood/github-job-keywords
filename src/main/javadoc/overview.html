<TITLE>Job Keywords Application Overview</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
    The Job-Keywords application extracts and counts keywords from job descriptions posted on Indeed.com.
    <p />
    The application integrates two RESTful APIs and stores the results in a MySQL database. The Indeed.com API provides
    the job search engine and returns detailed job descriptions to the app. The Five Filters API extracts terms (aka
    keywords or key-phrases) and returns the number of occurrences of each term to the app.
    <p />
    This application is built with Java 8, Spring 4.1.4, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL and Liquibase. One goal was to
    demonstrate the simplicity of building an application with Spring Boot. Another goal was to integrate the latest
    versions of open-source libraries which are popular and very powerful.
    <p />
    The Spring Boot framework automatically configures a bunch of stuff that used to be cumbersome when building Java
    Web Applications. While automatic configuration has many benefits, it can be tedious to figure out why the app
    breaks when manually overriding the auto-config. For example, it can be difficult to manually configure the database
    DataSources and TransactionManagers, Jackson's JSON and XML converters and the View Resolvers such as Thymeleaf, JSP
    and JSON.
